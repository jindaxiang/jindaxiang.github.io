### The Mid-term Homeword
#### Reading Materials
[Baidu](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E9%95%BF%E6%9C%9F%E8%B5%84%E6%9C%AC%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8/9505357?fr=aladdin), which is not very good for you. So i recommand that [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) to search the infomation about LTCM, also, you can read the [article](https://www.sohu.com/a/240167751_313170) written by analyst, who is come form Hong Ming Capital. At last but not least, I think this [material](https://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E9%95%BF%E6%9C%9F%E8%B5%84%E6%9C%AC%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8) is very useful.

If all above materials are not sufficient for you, you can find the useful information by yourself.
